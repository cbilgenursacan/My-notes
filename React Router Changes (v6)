Changes from React Router v5 to v6

1) Switch became Routes

2) Route now has element variable and we pass te component to it rather than use it as its child

3) We dont need exact key now (if necessary we still can use the old behaviour with adding * to our path)

4) activeClassName has gone we can use navData.isActive with arrow function

5) Redirect became Navigate (we can also use replace key if we dont want to push a new page)

6) We have to wrap our nested routes with Routes to work now

7) Now paths are relative so we dont have to use exact path in nested routes or links

8) Outline can be used for saying react where our ralative paths should be count

9) useHistory become useNavigate with changes (exp: navigate('/main', {replace: true}; (also we can navigate with numbers) )

10) Prompt is deleted
